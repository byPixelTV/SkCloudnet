# Final note
- SkCloudnet is very helpful if you are working with a CloudNet v4 instance. However, I currently hate maintaining this project because CloudNet does strange things, such as requiring Java 24 for all developers working with their API, which is very annoying. I don't use Skript or CloudNet anymore in general, which is why I'm archiving this project and won't be working on it in future.
